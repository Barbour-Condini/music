            After reading History at UCL,
            Charlotte was offered a postgraduate scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, where she studied
            recorder with Anna Stegmann and baroque violin with Nicolette Moonen.

            In 2012, Charlotte became the first recorder player to win the BBC Young Musician's woodwind

            Orchestra and Academy of Ancient Music, recitals across the UK and internationally, appearances on Radio 3’s <em>In Tune</em>
            and <em>Early Music Show</em>, and multiple composer collaborations.

            A keen ensemble musician, Charlotte co-founded Parandrus in 2017. With repertoire spanning from the 12th
            Century to new commissions, the ensemble has won awards in the UK and the Netherlands, and has been featured 
            on BBC Radio 3’s <em>Early Music Show</em> and <em>Early Music Now</em>.

            As a violinist, Charlotte is a founding member of the Chineke! Orchestra. She has also performed as a session musician 
            with The Good, the Bad and the Queen on <em>Later with Jools Holland</em>, and with Yebba and Mark Ronson on <em>Strictly
            Come Dancing</em>.
